        <!-- Dataset Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h2>1. ReMiCo Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The <b>ReMiCo</b> (<b>Re</b>al-world Dual Magnification <b>Mi</b>croscopic Image of mouse cerebral <b>Co</b>rtex vasculature) Dataset is a dual-magnification microscopic image database 
                of mouse cerebral cortex vasculature for the study of blood vessel segmentation and analysis. 
                The image data were collected at the <b>Takebe Laboratory, Institute of Science Tokyo</b>, 
                and the dataset was organized and developed by the <b>Mori Laboratory, Nagoya University</b>. 
                It was acquired <i>in vivo</i> using a Leica S9D dissecting microscope equipped with a single-lens camera system. 
                The dataset contains <b>210 paired low-magnification (LM, 1&times)</b> and <b>high-magnification (HM, 5&times)</b> images, 
                each with a resolution of <b>896 &times 896 pixels</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                During imaging, a about 5-7 mm-diameter cranial window was created on the mouse skull 
                to provide a stable optical access to cortical blood vessels. 
                Imaging was conducted approximately one week after surgery, following the reduction of inflammation, 
                under well-controlled illumination and focus conditions to ensure consistency across samples. 
                The field of view of each HM image is fully contained within the corresponding LM image, 
                and one LM image may correspond to multiple HM regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                To avoid data leakage, training and testing sets must be split by mouse case (since multiple images may come from different brain regions of the same mouse). If you would like to re-split the training and testing sets, 
                please refer to the detailed mouse case and image correspondence table:  
                <a class="link-btn" href="case_table.html">View Table</a>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The dataset is divided into training, validation and test sets as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Training set:</b> 124 paired LM–HM images (No. 001–123)</li>
                    <li><b>Validation set:</b> 21 paired LM–HM images (No. 124–144)</li>
                    <li><b>Test set:</b> 65 paired LM–HM images (No. 145–210)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                All animal experiments, breeding, maintenance, surgical procedures, 
                and intravital microscopy were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines 
                approved by the <b>Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Science Tokyo</b>.
            </p>
